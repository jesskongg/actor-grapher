## Actor Grapher

#### This is the Node.js web version of my previous Python tkinter application.

---

##### The Actor Grapher is a visualization tool that graphs the overall Rotten Tomatoes score of a given actor/actress or director. 
##### Will be deploying this application once I have solved error handling

Currently working on:
* Proper error handling, including flash messages upon an error
* Removing tooltips from the line of best fit
* Ability to click on any element and be taken to it's associated link
* Scaling the graph to fit the screen height-wise
* Adding another mode where the trend can be viewed for films in a given franchise (ie Marvel or Star Wars).
